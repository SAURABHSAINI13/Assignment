    <h1>Biography of Swami Vivekananda</h1>
<p><u><b>Swami Vivekananda (born Narendranath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata, India) was a Hindu monk, philosopher, and one of the most influential spiritual leaders of India. He played a crucial role in introducing Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is considered a key figure in the revival of Hinduism in modern India.</b></u></p>
Early Life and Education
<p>Narendranath was born into an educated and progressive Bengali family. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a lawyer, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was deeply spiritual. From a young age, Narendra was intelligent, curious, and had a deep interest in spiritual matters. He studied at Presidency College and later at the Scottish Church College, excelling in subjects like philosophy, logic, and literature.</p>

<p align="center">Spiritual Quest and Meeting Ramakrishna</p>
<p>In his youth, Vivekananda was deeply influenced by Western rationalism and questioned the existence of God. His quest for truth led him to Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a mystic saint of Dakshineswar. Under Ramakrishna’s guidance, Narendra realized the spiritual unity of all beings and the essence of Hindu teachings. After Ramakrishna’s death in 1886, he took monastic vows and became Swami Vivekananda.</p>
<br><br>
<p align="right">World Parliament of Religions, 1893</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda gained international fame when he represented Hinduism at the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. His powerful speech began with the famous words, “Sisters and brothers of America...” which received a standing ovation. He spoke about religious tolerance, the universality of all religions, and the richness of Indian spirituality.</p>
<br><br>
<p align="center">Work in India and Abroad</p>
<p>After his tour in the West, Vivekananda returned to India in 1897 and gave a series of inspiring lectures across the country. He emphasized the need for spiritual awakening, social service, and national pride. He founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897—a charitable, educational, and spiritual organization that continues his legacy today.
He traveled extensively, spreading messages of unity, selflessness, and spiritual strength both in India and the West. He inspired countless youth to serve society and strive for inner realization.</p>
<br><br>
Philosophy and Teachings
<p>Swami Vivekananda believed in the unity of all religions, the divinity of the soul, and the importance of selfless service (karma yoga). He promoted the ideals of Vedanta—the belief in the oneness of existence and the presence of the divine within every being.</p>
<br><br>
<p align="right">Death and Legacy</p>
<b>Swami Vivekananda passed away on July 4, 1902, at the young age of 39, at Belur Math, near Kolkata.</b> Despite his short life, his teachings have had a lasting impact on generations of Indians and spiritual seekers worldwide.</b>
His birthday, January 12, is celebrated as National Youth Day in India, honoring his contributions to youth empowerment and national awakening.</p>

<!-- Section 3: Daily Routine -->
<h1>My Daily Routine</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Saurabh Saini, and here's a glimpse into how I usually spend my day. Maintaining a balanced and productive routine is important to me, and I try to stay consistent with my schedule to make the most out of each day.</p>

<h2>Morning</h2>
I usually wake up around 6:30 AM. After freshening up, I begin my day with a short morning walk or light exercise to energize myself. I follow this with meditation or a bit of reading to set a positive tone for the day. Around 7:30 AM, I have a healthy breakfast and get ready for work or classes.

<h2>Daytime</h2>
My daytime routine mainly revolves around studying, coding, or working on internship tasks or personal projects. I also attend lectures or meetings if I have any scheduled. I usually take a lunch break around 1:00 PM and then continue with my academic or work-related tasks.

<h2>Evening</h2>
I wrap up my work by 6:00 PM and spend some time relaxing—either by playing football, watching a movie, or reading a book. Sometimes, I also explore machine learning concepts or contribute to open-source projects during this time.

<h2>Night</h2>
Dinner is usually around 8:30 PM, after which I take some time to wind down—perhaps scrolling through social media or chatting with friends. Before going to bed, I plan out the next day or review what I’ve accomplished. I try to sleep by 11:00 PM to ensure I get enough rest.
